    <h1 class="text-left">"GoodNight" Mobile App Case Study</h1>
        <p>
            Due to the years-long restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
            travelers and non-travelers alike looked for an escape from the realities of their conventional, 
            daily stresses by exploring more of the world that was previously restricted to them. 
            Our team recognizes that travelers want to take advantage of all the hours that were lost to them, 
            and they want to explore all the opportunities that a new place has to offer, whether during the day or during the night. 

            We want to develop an app that allows users to research and filter different nightlife activities based on the userâ€™s unique interests.
