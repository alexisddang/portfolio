                    <h3>Research Background</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Due to the years-long restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, travelers and non-travelers alike looked for an escape from the realities 
                        of their conventional, daily stresses by exploring more of the world that was previously restricted to them. Our team recognizes that travelers 
                        want to take advantage of all the hours that were lost to them, and they want to explore <em>all</em> the opportunities that a new place has to offer, 
                        whether during the day or during the night.
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        We wanted to develop an app that allows users to research and filter different nightlife activities based on the user's unique interests.</p>

                <h3>Proto Persona</h3>
                <br>
                <p>This proto persona was created based off very basic assumptions of who a traveler might be, how a traveler might be living, what a traveler might want, 
                    and what a traveler might be frustrated by. At this point in the process, our team had a vague idea of creating an application that appealed to a 
                    user's interests, hence points like “Needs his interest piqued before choosing to go somewhere” and his pain point of “Pop music.”</p>

                <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Prior to coming up with our interview questions, our team considered that most people traveled for relaxation and leisure. 
                    Moreover, we were aware that the most abundant individuals we had in our respective social circles were young adults. With these considerations in mind, 
                    we determined that “nightlife” had the most overlap with the aspects of relaxation and leisure and the lifestyles of most young adults. 
                    Our interview questions were created with the intention to research young adult habits, preferences, and pain points when it came to planning a night out. 
                    Our team conducted six interviews total.</p>

                "I like...", "I wish...", and "What if..." statements. The statements were then divided into more specific categories based on similarity. Our team 
                then dot-voted on the statements that we thought would be the most valuable in an app. We gave ourselves two votes each per category, and limited ourselves 
                to one vote each in categories that had fewer options. Any statement that received more than two votes was then moved into a feature categorization matrix 
                 as well as organized into a value proposition canvas.

            <p>Lastly, before the prototyping phase of design, our team identified direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors were chosen to analyze existing 
                features that they utilized to handle the problems we defined while indirect competitors were chosen to explore situations we might not have covered in our 
                analyses and storytelling. With both the direct competitors and indirect competitors, we noted features, competitive advantages, strengths, and weaknesses. 
                We also compared the onboarding of the direct competitors to determine which platform had the most streamlined process.</p>

            <p id="prototyping">At this point in the project, our group separated to create our own versions of a mobile app prototype based on the research we conducted together. 
                In the first step of this process, I created a basic user flow that included the onboarding process into the app as well as basic features I wanted to 
                include in the first few iterations. I then created rough sketches on pen and paper. This allowed me to brainstorm different layouts and quickly visualize 
                what the app's content and features might look like on a phone screen.</p>

            <h3>LoFi Prototypes</h3>
            <br> 
            <p>Then, in Figma, I mapped out some of the flow and some of the layout I had drafted. This resulted in my first low-fidelity prototype. I conducted some 
                user tests with this first prototype and made the following notes that users wanted to see improvements on:</p>
            <ul class="bodyList">
                <li>Lower input fields</li>
                <li>Remove option to sign up for Facebook and replace with Gmail, phone number, and Instagram</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I took these suggestions to iterate a second version of my first prototype. The second low-fidelity prototype iteration had an improved onboarding process 
                based on the user tests as well as the addition of features that I had included in my user flow. <span>Click the images below to visit and interact with the

            <p>As there were no significant comments about my second iteration in my user tests, I moved on to create a mid-fidelity / high-fidelity prototype. 
                Before drafting out the prototype in Figma, I iterated my user flow to include additional features that were not included in my second iteration.</p>

                <p>I also fleshed out the existing features, added more interactivity, and applied a color palette and other stylings so the overall look of the app would be cohesive.

            <p>After completing the mid / high-fidelity prototype to the point of usability, I tested the prototype with three users. I gave my users three tasks to complete 
                and each task included corresponding research questions and success criteria for my own reference. A compilation of their feedback is also included below.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 40px;">Completing this project and this case study was an extremely valuable experience. If I were to continue working on the “GoodNight” app, I would expand 
                    the scope of the app and add more functional features including music queues for select venues, interactive photo galleries, interactive user reviews, 
                    and other features that were in the feature prioritization matrix. Per my user feedback, I would also experiment with different and more aesthetically 
                    pleasing color schemes as well as with different typefaces. (It was a total accident that the typeface for this application was the same typeface for 
                    my portfolio!) And of course, I would continue to create more interactivity in my prototype and increase its fidelity. </p>
