                    <br>
                    <p>The premise for this project was simple. Our group was tasked with identifying a problem and creating a mobile app to address and solve said problem. 
                        Our group knew we wanted our project to be entertaining, fun, and enjoyable to work on over the three weeks we were given. And what's more entertaining, 
                        fun, and enjoyable than dating in the 21st century?
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        Our group decided to create a mobile dating app that puts a twist on the tried and true dating app model by including third-parties in the 
                        matchmaking process.

                    a user to involve other people in their match-seeking journey. This resulted in our first iteration of a persona: "Ana."

                    <li>The role of a user's friends / close ones in their dating lives</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We interviewed six individuals one-on-one with discussions led by the following interview questions.</p>

                <h3>Interview Findings</h3>
                <br>
                <p>At the time of the interviews, three of the interview respondents were single while the other three respondents were in a relationship. All six respondents 
                    had experience with dating apps and maintained close, personal relationships with their friends and family. Tinder was the most popular existing dating app that 
                    our respondents used or had experience with, followed closely behind by Hinge and Bumble.
                    <br>
                    We took the interview responses and organized the statements into an affinity diagram and an empathy map. We then fully fleshed out our user 
                    persona and aptly named her "Ana Singleton." With a more well-defined persona, we created our user insight statement and a problem statement that would 
                    better guide us in our app creation.

                        <p class="card-text">We have observed that many young adults looking for a date share screenshots of their potential dates' profiles to their close friends 
                            so they can get their opinion and validation. How might we help young, single adults who need validation on their dates gain more confidence and 
                            have more a exciting and safe dating experience?

            <p>Next, we organized the information we gathered from our interviewees into formats that would be more useful for us in our app creation. We took common 
                comments from the affinity diagram and organized them into "I like...", "I wish...", and "What if..." statements. We viewed these statements as potential 
                features that could be included in a dating app and to narrow the features down, we dot-voted on features that we wanted to expand upon. The features that had 
                votes were then placed in a feature categorization matrix. A profile preferences feature and a profile verification feature were two features that seemed to be the 
                most popular. All of this information was further condensed and organized into a value proposition canvas that would allow us to ensure our app would be focused 
                on our users' needs.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Of course, we are not pioneers to the genre of dating apps, so we made sure to carefully analyze existing dating apps on the market. We noted the apps' features 
                as well as their strengths and weaknesses. By analyzing these features, we could more easily identify what was standard across all the apps and what we wanted 
                to include in our own app. In our search for competitors, we found the existing app, "Wingman," that had a premise almost identical to our own. This similarity 
                did not deter us from continuing to design our app; rather, we felt more encouraged that our idea was something users would be interested in seeing and using. 
                Additionally, we were able to see what aspects Wingman was lacking in and ensure we avoided similar issues in our own design.</p>

            <h3 id="prototyping">User Flow</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Prototyping is my favorite part of the design process. Finally getting this app put together began with creating a user flow. However, we quickly realized that due 
                to the premise of our app (which we decided to name "Wingmates"), we had two user flows that could be explored. First, there was the user looking to date. Then, 
                there was the user looking to find dates for their friends: the "wingmate." The user flow reflects that much of the functionality of the app would be the same for 
                the two different types of users, though the motivations of the users would be much different, and as such, the app would require different features for the user to 
                accomplish his or her respective goals. Due to the time constraints of this project, our group decided that we only had the bandwidth to explore one of these user 
                flow. Our user persona, Ana Singleton, more closely aligned with the first type of user flow and we fleshed out the user flow and the features of the app with her 
                motivations in mind.
