        <p>
            Due to the years-long restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
            travelers and non-travelers alike looked for an escape from the realities of their conventional, 
            daily stresses by exploring more of the world that was previously restricted to them. 
            Our team recognizes that travelers want to take advantage of all the hours that were lost to them, 
            and they want to explore <em>all</em> the opportunities that a new place has to offer, whether during the day or during the night. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We wanted to develop an app that allows users to research and filter different nightlife activities based on the user's unique interests. 
        </p>

    <h1 class="text-center" id="personaCreation">Persona Creation & Interviews</h1>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="protoImg" src="images/protopersona.png" alt="...">
        </div>

        <p>
            This proto persona was created based off very basic assumptions of who a traveler might be, how a traveler might be living, what a traveler might want, 
            and what a traveler might be frustrated by. 
            At this point in the process, our team had a vague idea of creating an application that appealed to a user's interests, 
            hence points like <em>“Needs his interest piqued before choosing to go somewhere”</em> and his pain point of <em>“Pop music.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Prior to coming up with our interview questions, our team considered that most people traveled for relaxation and leisure. 
            Moreover, we were aware that the most abundant individuals we had in our respective social circles were young adults. With these considerations in mind, 
            we determined that “nightlife” had the most overlap with the aspects of relaxation and leisure and the lifestyles of most young adults. 
            Our interview questions were created with the intention to research young adult habits, preferences, and pain points when it came to planning a night out.

            After completing our user interviews, our team created and organized an affinity diagram and an empathy map, which led to the 
            creation of our final user persona.

        <h2 class="text-left">User Insight Statement</h2>
          <p>Liam Cummings and other young adults need nightlife activities to destress and unwind because nightlife activities 
            can help relieve pressure from work and pressure from personal issues, as well as allow young adults to enjoy time socializing with people after a long week.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Young adults struggle to plan a night out because they cannot filter bars, clubs, or other nightlife activities based on their interests through one service. 
            How might our team ease the frustrations of finding nightlife activities that appeal to the unique interests of young adults?

            A rough user flow was created to include features from the feature prioritization matrix that our team wanted to represent. 
            This user flow was eventually used as the basis of the app prototype.

            So obviously this page is not done, but it's a rough and less pretty idea of how I would want to structure my project pages.
            What's next in terms of designing this portfolio page is finishing adding the elements from my case study into the page,
            create a more story-like structure to the study, making the breadcrumb navbar responsive, utilizing more columns to break up 
            long lines of text, and adding an option to open images to their full size. More aesthetic changes will be made on the fly.
