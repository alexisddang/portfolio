                    <h3>Research Background</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Due to the years-long restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, travelers and non-travelers alike looked for an escape from the realities 
                        of their conventional, daily stresses by exploring more of the world that was previously restricted to them. Our team recognizes that travelers 
                        want to take advantage of all the hours that were lost to them, and they want to explore <em>all</em> the opportunities that a new place has to offer, 
                        whether during the day or during the night.
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        We wanted to develop an app that allows users to research and filter different nightlife activities based on the user's unique interests.</p>

                <h3>Proto Persona</h3>
                <br>
                <p>This proto persona was created based off very basic assumptions of who a traveler might be, how a traveler might be living, what a traveler might want, 
                    and what a traveler might be frustrated by. At this point in the process, our team had a vague idea of creating an application that appealed to a 
                    user's interests, hence points like “Needs his interest piqued before choosing to go somewhere” and his pain point of “Pop music.”</p>

                <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Prior to coming up with our interview questions, our team considered that most people traveled for relaxation and leisure. 
                    Moreover, we were aware that the most abundant individuals we had in our respective social circles were young adults. With these considerations in mind, 
                    we determined that “nightlife” had the most overlap with the aspects of relaxation and leisure and the lifestyles of most young adults. 
                    Our interview questions were created with the intention to research young adult habits, preferences, and pain points when it came to planning a night out. 
                    Our team conducted six interviews total.</p>

            <p>From our interview responses and affinity diagrams, we condensed similar comments across the six interviews and separated these comments into 
                "I like...", "I wish...", and "What if..." statements. The statements were then divided into more specific categories based on similarity. Our team 
                then dot-voted on the statements that we thought would be the most valuable in an app. We gave ourselves two votes each per category, and limited ourselves 
                to one vote each in categories that had fewer options. Any statement that received more than two votes was then moved into a feature categorization matrix 
                 as well as organized into a value proposition canvas.
